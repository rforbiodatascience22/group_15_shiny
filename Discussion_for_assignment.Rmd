# Discussion about Shiny app creation

**What did you find most challenging about creating a shiny app?**

**What do you feel are the benefits and challenges with using golem for app development?**

**Maintaining reproducibility when using shiny apps is a challenge. As an example, some pharma-companies display databases to medical doctors for pointy-clicky data exploration. What are your thoughts on maintaining reproducibility in that scenario? What if the database is updated or the app is updated with new or changed functionality?**

**What other challenges and limitations do you see shiny apps may have? Please elaborate.**

*Deploy the updated app to shinyapps.io.*

*Hand in a pdf with you discussion points and links to your shiny app GitHub page and the shinyapps.io app.*
